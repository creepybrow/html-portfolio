    <h1>Welcome To TKOJ</h1>
<p>Hello! and welcome to the Knights of Jay homepage. I didn't create the Knights of Jay. A few buddies inspired me to showcase who I am. Not through notebook, but through the art of computer science. My first experience is through the use of web design.
</p>
<p>I'll let the webpage showcase itself.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>This movie had a great plot I never expected.</li>
    <li>Very well thought out, and it kept me guessing the whole way</li>
    <li>I actually was stunned with the conclusion. Brilliant writing.</li>
    </ul> 
    <br />
        <br />

        <h3>My favorite quotes</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>"I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be Caged."(Morgan Freeman)</li>

<h3><a href="../2.4 Movie Ranking Project/index.html">Patch Adams</a></h3>
<p>This movie was very dear to me. It showed a doctor who <br />
wasn't about the paycheck. He really cared about healing through <br />
more than just medicine. Took the time to use emotions to give patients <br />
less fortunate than he was the time of their life.</p>
<ul>
    <li>"You Treat A disease, You Win, You Lose.</li>
    <li>You Treat A Person, I guarantee You, You'll Win</li>
    <li>No Matter What Outcome."(patch Adams)</li>
<li>"The Purpose of a doctor or any human in general
    should not be to simply delay the death of the patient
    but to increase the person's quality of life."(Patch Adams)</li>
</ul>
